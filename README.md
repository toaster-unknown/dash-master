# This is the dash master readme!
**DASH MASTER IS JUST A SIMPLE MOUSE GAME, HONESTLY I DONT KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO PLAY IT**

first of it may be detected as a virus but thats just because of the compiler(i think), 
second these are all the existing moves:

	simple dash:
		click anywhere you want to perform this move

	normal dash:
		click anywhere in the sky then click somewhere to the side(or down when stamina is low) so that a smoke trail appears

	super dash:
		click anywhere in the sky then click as fast as you can down so that an explosion appears
		note: the further down you click the bigger the explosion

	ultra dash:
		hold right mouse button and then perform a super dash
		note: you can only do this once's and this will fully lower you stamina bar

all others:

	stamina:
		do keep a look at your stamina because you can only perform a super/ultra dash when the stamina bar is full
		and when the stamina bar is completely lowered you can only perform a simple dash until its full again

	enemies:
		look out for these they will give you damage when you touch them

that's all the information you need, there may be some glitches because the game is still in progress
